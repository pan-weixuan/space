<br>
I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Physics and Materials Science](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/), [Guangzhou University](https://www.gzhu.edu.cn/).
My research interest includes galaxy formation and evolution, as well as the large-scale structure of the universe. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Mao Yewei](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1681/18121.htm) from [School of Physics and Materials Science](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/), Guangzhou University, to conduct research on galaxy spectra and multiwavelength morphology of galaxies. I also received training in numerical simulations of the cosmological large-scale structure under the supervision of [Dr. Wang Qiao](https://nao.cas.cn/jypy/ds/ssds/202204/t20220406_6419582.html), from [National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC)](https://english.nao.cas.cn/)
